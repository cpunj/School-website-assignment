Purpose of the website-
I have tried to keep the website simple and easy for users on both mobile version and desktop
version. I have put the design pretty simple for pages as brighter colors or images
irritates the user's eyes while browsing. Careful consideration was given towards
the options present in the website to make it easier for the users to perform the 
functions they want. The enrolment page is minimalized to just two bars which when
clicked display the units available in a particular year. Like this way the site was
kept very simplistic.

Functions for the website -
- User will be easily able to navigate from page to another using the navigation bar.
- User will be able to sign up by filling a simple registration form.
- DC and UC will be easily able to edit details in the master page.
- The timetable will be able to display the timetable in both all weeks format and 
current week format.
